# Megin finishing delivery

Read [../megin/references/language-policy.md](../megin/references/language-policy.md) and
[../megin/references/group-workspace.md](../megin/references/group-workspace.md) and
[../megin/references/branch-policy.md](../megin/references/branch-policy.md) before creating
delivery notes. Write human-readable delivery summaries in Traditional Chinese while preserving
commit IDs, staged paths, commands, and status values exactly.

Use only after `megin-human-acceptance` records the exact Work ID and acceptance version. Confirm
Group root, all selected Repo paths and feature branches, per-Repo approved paths, reviewed and
verified composite snapshot, knowledge scope, delivery mode, and final diffs. Confirm each remote
and base still matches its approved target and acceptance covers this exact snapshot. Stop on
unrelated files, remote or branch drift, stale evidence, or an unauthorized target.
For a new or resumed change, confirm the accepted Group snapshot, then stage only approved paths in
each Repo and run the Group read-only `delivery` gate with `--group-root` and `--work-id` from
[../megin/references/quality-gates.md](../megin/references/quality-gates.md). Preserve its raw
output. The gate checks every remote tip and staged per-Repo digest and rejects remaining unstaged
or untracked product paths. Staging does not retroactively turn an unreviewed edit into an accepted change.

Run `megin-project-knowledge` over the approved source-backed scope. Preserve unsupported or
conflicting claims as pending and leave canonical knowledge unchanged unless the repository's
promotion contract and the approved scope permit the update.

Stage only approved product, test, documentation, and authorized knowledge paths in each feature
branch. For one Repo, create its feature commit; verify the remote still points to the approved base
SHA; switch to a clean local base; fast-forward it with `git merge --ff-only <confirmed-base-commit>`;
then use `git merge --no-ff <feature_branch>` and verify both parents and content equivalence.

For two or more Repos, create one feature commit in each feature branch and do not merge any base
branch. Record each Repo's path, remote/base, feature branch, feature commit, and user-facing manual
merge handoff. If only some commits finish, preserve them and resume the remaining commits without
rebuilding completed ones. Remote drift or divergence invalidates acceptance and stops delivery.
Push, pull requests, deployment, branch deletion, and worktree cleanup remain outside this Skill.

Handoff: set `status: complete` after recording the knowledge result and every Repo's feature commit.
For one Repo also record the `--no-ff` merge and integration checks; for multiple Repos record the
manual-merge details and no base merge. Otherwise leave the exact pending Repo/action in the central
`workflow.md`.
