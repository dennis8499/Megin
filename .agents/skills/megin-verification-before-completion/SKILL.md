# Megin verification

Read [../megin/references/language-policy.md](../megin/references/language-policy.md) and
[../megin/references/branch-policy.md](../megin/references/branch-policy.md) before creating
verification records. Write verification explanations and scenario results in Traditional Chinese
while preserving commands, status values, paths, digests, and raw output exactly.

Load the exact approved scope, acceptance, commands, latest writer reports, fresh review verdict,
knowledge scope, and delivery destination. Inspect status, diff, `base_branch`, `base_commit`,
`feature_branch`, and snapshot; reject scope or branch drift and stale evidence. Run every approved
focused, related, full, static, build, contract, and scenario command that applies, recording the
exact command, exit status, output path, and digest where required. Do not stage, commit, or merge
as part of automated verification.
Apply [../megin/references/quality-gates.md](../megin/references/quality-gates.md): record the
actual number of tests executed, failed, and skipped where the command is a test. Do not infer
success from a zero exit with no matching tests or from a missing environment. Check the read-only
`acceptance` gate before advancing the workflow status.
Each saved command output starts with its exact `Command:` and `Exit code:` lines and cites those
claim locators plus the result/count line in the quality evidence.

Confirm the fresh reviewer approved the same snapshot and that knowledge claims retain source paths,
digests, certainty, and conflict results. A failed command, base-branch advance, or feature snapshot
change returns the affected task to implementation for a bounded fix or rebase/merge recovery, then
requires a fresh review and verification.

When all automated obligations pass, write a final verification record and set `status:
awaiting_user` with `phase: acceptance`. Product files, knowledge, staging, and commit state remain
unchanged until the human acceptance response.
