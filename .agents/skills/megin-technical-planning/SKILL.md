# Megin technical planning

Read [../megin/references/language-policy.md](../megin/references/language-policy.md),
[../megin/references/group-workspace.md](../megin/references/group-workspace.md),
[../megin/references/branch-policy.md](../megin/references/branch-policy.md), and
[../megin/references/requirements-discovery-protocol.md](../megin/references/requirements-discovery-protocol.md)
before creating or updating a plan. Work read-only after `megin-requirements-discovery` has produced a current
requirements revision. Re-read `requirements.md`, its sources, capability coverage, decisions, blockers, and acceptance
against the protocol's completion conditions. If any major unknown could change the goal, audience, boundary, interface,
important risk, core behavior, or acceptance, return to requirements discovery and keep `phase: requirements` with
`status: awaiting_user`; do not write or present a plan. Never treat a `ready_for_planning` flag, question count, or
document existence as proof of completion.
Read each selected Repo's own code, tests, project knowledge, remote configuration, base branch, and available validation commands. During planning query each exact remote ref with `git ls-remote --exit-code`; do not substitute a local tracking ref. Keep the smallest
safe design; classify the work as small or large by impact and uncertainty rather than line count.
Resolve each Repo's remote and base branch field from explicit user input, an exact Repo override in
optional `<Group>/.megin/group.json`, Group defaults, then existing project discovery. The config is
not a Repo allowlist. Use `group_workspace.py resolve` to record each value's source and the config
SHA-256; if a setting remains unknown, ask before presenting the plan. Later config edits do not
change this plan. Compute and save the sorted twelve-Skill fingerprint with
`group_workspace.py fingerprint`. For multi-Repo work, declare every Repo's merge prerequisites,
complete topological order, compatibility check IDs, and partial-delivery recovery instructions;
record a reason when the Repos are independent.
Read [../megin/references/quality-gates.md](../megin/references/quality-gates.md) for the shared
obligation and snapshot contract. Map each observable result to a meaningful assertion, exact
command, and required environment; split independently failing promises. Include failure paths
only when the change makes them relevant. The plan remains the sole source of approved obligations.

Write `plan.md` in the central Group Work ID record. It must bind the canonical Group root, each
selected Repo path, remote name/URL, exact remote base SHA, `feature/<Work ID>`, Repo-relative allowed paths, and every check's
explicit command and `cwd`, as well as the requirements revision, interfaces, dependency-ordered
work packages, forbidden paths, acceptance scenarios, evidence locations, knowledge scope, and
delivery mode, frozen settings resolution and sources, Skills fingerprint, and cross-Repo handoff
graph. For `local_merge`, specify the fast-forward-to-confirmed-base then `--no-ff` local merge;
for `feature_handoff`, specify feature commits and per-Repo manual handoff without base merges.
For `gitlab_mr`, specify accepted staged handoff, native lock transfer and workspace-owned local
commits/Push/MR without base merges, for one or more Repos. Each package has
one writer handoff and one fresh-review handoff. Include migration and failure
handling when the change affects data, permissions, dependencies, compatibility, or operational
behavior.

The plan remains read-only. Once the user explicitly approves the exact Work ID and plan version,
the implementation handoff creates the named feature branch from the recorded base commit before
any product write; direct development on the base branch is not an allowed implementation path.

Present the complete plan as the single approval gate. Wait for an explicit response naming the Work
ID and plan version. Any changed scope, interface, scenario, command, or destination supersedes the
plan and returns the work here.

Handoff: `phase: approval` with a reviewable, complete plan; approval is not implied by producing it.

For a GitlabWorkSpace task, freeze `delivery_mode: gitlab_mr` and the GitLab/Issue/Repo identities described in [../megin/references/gitlab-delivery.md](../megin/references/gitlab-delivery.md); predeclare handoff.json before any quality snapshot.
