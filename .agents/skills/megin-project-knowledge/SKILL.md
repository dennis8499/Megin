# Megin project knowledge

Read [../megin/references/language-policy.md](../megin/references/language-policy.md) before
creating or updating knowledge notes. Write human-readable provenance, decisions, and event text in
Traditional Chinese while preserving source paths, identifiers, commands, and digests verbatim.

Use the repository's documented knowledge layout and source references. Search before requirements,
planning, implementation, diagnosis, or an ad-hoc engineering answer. Re-read every selected source
at its recorded path and locator; exclude stale, contested, superseded, hash-drifted, or self-
referential material.

During planning, define the approved `knowledge_scope`. During review and delivery, compare the
approved scope with the source-backed result, preserve source paths, certainty, and content digests,
and record conflicts as pending instead of overwriting canonical claims. Keep knowledge changes
outside the product diff until human acceptance. If the repository has a formal lint or promotion
contract, follow it; otherwise create a reviewable candidate in the Work ID directory and record
the exact source and postimage paths.

This Skill does not stage, commit, push, merge, or publish. Handoff is a knowledge result of
`promoted`, `pending`, or `no-change`, with evidence and one next action.
